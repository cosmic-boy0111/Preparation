sorted array -> think binary Search

output is greater than input, choise, or next step is depend upon the previous one or problem is recursively design -> think recursion

if previous data is going to use or in O(n^2) the second loop is somehow depends on the previous one like first is ith loop and second is jth loop is jth loop using the i in its condition -> think stack

if next data is going to help in next stage -> think queue

if for current state the ans is depend on from whole previous data -> think Precomputation
